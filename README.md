# MakeQtGame
The branch master keeps the basic code to run the application withouth arise in errors.
Other experiments about the game's topics will be discussed over the other branches
started from this.

## Technical Report
Any experiments **must have** an attached technical report writed in the README.md file on
the experiment's directory. I found "The Technical Report Format" of the *University of Kansas*'
EECS course and I thing that it's a very pretty and complete report structure. The following
table shows a rapidly abstract of the report's parts:

| Section | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| Title Page | The title of the experiment |
| Abstract | Explain what you want change in the program |
| Table contents | Include all the report sections, subsections, and appendices |
| Introduction | Explain whay did you do, why did you do and the main results |
| Body | Write as many as possible about the experiment. The diagrams, images and table are very useful. |
| Conclusion | Is the experiment's result significative? |
| References | The source of your information |
| Appendices | Some explanation |

More detailed explanations should be found here:

Some notes: the table of contents is very usefull but it's not mandatory. The
Markdown is not as LaTeX but it's a strument to simplify the writing and the
publishing of the experiment: so, don't worry! Also for the *Appendices* section,
never mind. 

The only raccomandation is about the *Reference*. If you derive an experiments
from one or more other experiments, you will put their name them so it's easy
to understand what you did.
