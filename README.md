# Experiment Qt Game
The branch master keeps the basic code to run the application withouth arise in
any errors. The other experiments on the many topics about a game will be
tried over the other branches started from here.

## Technical Report
Any times that an experiment is builded create, in the experiment's directory,
a README.md file with a techical report about it. I taked the **Technical 
Report Format** of the *University of Kansas*' EECS course. The following
table show a rapidly abstract of the report's parts:
| Section | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| Title Page | The title of the experiment |
| Abstract | Explain what you want change in the program |
| Table contents | Include all the report sections, subsections, and appendices |
| Introduction | Explain whay did you do, why did you do and the main result |
| Body | Write as many as possible about the experiment. The diagrams, images and table are very useful. |
Conclusion | Is the experiment's result significative? |
References | The source of your information |
Appendices | Some explanation|

More detailed explanations will be found here:

Some notes: the table of contents is very usefull but it's not mandatory. The
markdown isn't LaTeX but it's a strument to simplify the writing and the
to publish the experiment: don't worry! Also for the *Appendices* section,
never mind. 

The only raccomandation is about the *Reference*. If your experiment derives
from one or more other experiments, put the name of branches them so it's easy
to understand what you did.
